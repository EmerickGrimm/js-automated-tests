# JavaScript Automated Tests Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for JavaScript automated tests! Here you will find a collection of scripts and tests that I've completed during courses. Each folder within this repository corresponds to a different topic, and contains its own README.md file with information about the tasks and exercises covered.

## Current Stack

The current stack used for these automated tests includes:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for server-side scripting and automation.
- **Selenium**: A portable framework for automating web browsers, enabling interaction with web elements and simulating user actions.
- **Mocha**: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- **Chai**: An assertion library for Node.js and the browser, providing a wide range of assertions to make tests readable and expressive.

## Contributions

I will continue to update this repository with new scripts and tests as I complete more courses or learn new techniques. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome! If you have any questions or improvements to suggest, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
